# NAME

App::timekeeper - Create shareable timer

# SYNOPSIS

    $ ./timekeeper daemon --listen http://*:3000

# DESCRIPTION

[Timekeeper](https://github.com/jhthorsen/app-timekeeper) is web app for
creating shareable timers.

Simply copy and paste the URL in your browser to a friend or coworker, after
[setting a timer](https://timer.thorsen.pm).

The idea came when my friend kept saying "Yeah, right", and I wanted to prove I
could do "something" in the amount of time that I had promised.

See [https://timer.thorsen.pm](https://timer.thorsen.pm) for a live demo.

You can also run this application inside Docker:
[https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/jhthorsen/timekeeper](https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/jhthorsen/timekeeper).
