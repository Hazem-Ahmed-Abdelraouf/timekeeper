# NAME

Timekeeper - Create a shareable timer

# DESCRIPTION

[Timekeeper](https://github.com/jhthorsen/timekeeper) is web app for
creating shareable timers.

Simply copy and paste the URL in your browser to a friend or coworker, after
[setting a timer](https://timer.thorsen.pm).

The idea came when my friend kept saying "Yeah, right", and I wanted to prove I
could do "something" in the amount of time that I had promised.
